INTRODUCTION                                                     *csound-repl*

This plugin provides basic functionality to send Csound code over UDP to a
running instance of Csound. This will allow you to interactively evaluate and
compile new instruments and UDOs, update existing instruments and UDOs, as
well as execute opcode calls in instrument 0 space.

This plugin is best used together with Luis Jure's csound-vim plugin
(https://github.com/ljure/csound).


REQUIREMENTS                                        *csound-repl:requirements*

This plugin requires that the version of Vim used has Python support built-in. 

SETTING UP CSOUND REPL                                     *csound-repl:setup*

csound-repl is preconfigured to run with UDP port 10000. If you need to use a
different port, execute the command ":call Csound_set_port(portNumber)" with
the port number you would like to use.

Currently, Csound itself should be started in a separate terminal with the
--port command. For example: 

  csound --port=10000 some.csd

This will begin Csound in server mode and evaluate some.csd as initial code.
Once Csound is running, you will be able to use this plugin to evaluate and
send code to that running Csound instance. 

EVALUATING CODE                                             *csound-repl:eval*


                                                    *csound-repl:evaluate_orc*
<leader>eo              In visual mode, evaluates selected Csound code as 
                        Orchestra code.

                        In normal mode, it will select the surrounding UDO or
                        instrument (if found) and evaluate that. Otherwise,
                        will evaluate the current line.

                                                    *csound-repl:evaluate_sco*
<leader>es              Evaluate selected Csound code as Score code.
                        (Does not currently work as Csound Server mode only
                        accepts orchestra code at this time.)
